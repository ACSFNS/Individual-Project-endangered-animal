    <h1>Information on the Arctic Fox</h1>
    <h3>life span</h3>
    <p>Arctic foxes live for three to six years</p><br />
    <p>the average gestation period is four to five weeks. Births occur from April through June for the first litter and in July or August for the second litter. Usual litter size is five to eight kits</p><br />
    <p>In Alaska, Arctic foxes migrate from their fall breeding grounds and travel to coastal areas, returning in late winter or early spring</p><br />
    
    <h3>food</h3>
    <p>Arctic foxes are opportunistic feeders, eating practically any animal alive or dead</p><br />
    <p> Arctic foxes collect a surplus of food and carry it back to their dens to bury and store</p><br />
    <p>Come wintertime when prey is scarce, they will follow polar bears and wolves to scavenge the remains of their kills</p><br />

    <h3>Endangerment</h3>
    <p> most populations of arctic fox have been in decline due to overhunting and lack of food sources</p>
    <p> Arctic foxes are threatened by global warming, competiton from the red fox population, and hunting and trapping for their fur</p>
